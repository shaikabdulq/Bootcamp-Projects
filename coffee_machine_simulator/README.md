# Coffee Vending Machine

## Overview
This project simulates a simple coffee vending machine using Python. It allows users to select from a variety of coffee types, handles the transaction process, and manages resources.

## Features
- **Coffee Selection**: Users can choose from espresso, latte, or cappuccino.
- **Resource Management**: The machine checks if sufficient resources (water, milk, coffee) are available to make the selected coffee.
- **Payment Processing**: Users can enter the amount in different denominations, and the machine processes the transaction and returns change if necessary.
- **Reporting**: Users can view the current resources and total profit of the machine.

## How to Use
1. **Start the Machine**: Run the script to start the coffee vending machine.
2. **Select a Drink**: Input your choice of drink (`espresso`, `latte`, `cappuccino`), or choose `report` to view the machine's resources and profit, or `off` to turn off the machine.
3. **Payment**: If a drink is selected, the machine will ask for the payment. Input the number of notes for each denomination as prompted.
4. **Enjoy Your Coffee**: If the transaction is successful and resources are sufficient, the machine will make your coffee.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11
